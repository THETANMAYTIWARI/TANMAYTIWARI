## Hello, World!

Hello everyone! I am TANMAY, and I am delighted to introduce myself as a student at VIT Chennai. I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in Business Analytics.

## My GitHub Repository

To document and showcase my journey as a student of CSE with a specialization in Business Analytics, I have created a GitHub repository. This repository serves as a platform where I share my coding projects, data analysis assignments, and other relevant work. It is a testament to my growth as a developer and data analyst throughout my academic journey.

Through my GitHub repository, I aim to contribute to the open-source community by sharing my code, insights, and experiences. I believe in the power of collaboration and learning from others, and GitHub provides the perfect platform to engage with like-minded individuals and professionals in the field.

I invite you to explore my GitHub repository, where you will find a diverse range of projects and code samples related to data analysis, machine learning, and business analytics. Your feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are highly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!
